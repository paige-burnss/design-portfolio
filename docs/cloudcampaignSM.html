        <h6>
          <br>During Summer 2022, I was a Product Design Intern at <a href="https://www.cloudcampaign.com"
            class="linked">Cloud Campaign</a> (CC), a white-label, scalable social media management and marketing
          software company. As an intern, I worked on both their Social Suite product and Agency Hub beta-release
          product. <br><br> Agency Hub(AH) is a social media agency management software that allows agencies to organize
          their clients needs, plans, and to-dos all in one place. The beta-release of this product launched during
          summer 2022.
          Throughout the summer, I worked on a feature called “Service Management”, which
          would allow agencies to assign their specific plans(how much social media management their client pays for)
          to specific clients. I worked on this feature from <mark class="mark">beginning to end of the UX
            design process.</mark>

        <h4>PRODUCT FUNCTIONALITY DESCRIPTION:</h4>
        <h6><i>What is Service Management?</i><br><br>This new feature is meant to help agencies define and assign their
          specific services to each customer they are managing. A service is a <mark class="mark">task that an agency
            will help their clients with</mark>, such as social media management or
          email marketing management. With the service management function, agencies would be able to create different
          ‘tiers’ of each service, or amounts of service that they would give to different paying
          customers. Agencies would then be able to assign those specific service tiers to different customers
          they are managing in Agency Hub.</h6>

        </div><br>
        <h6><i>What is Package Management?</i><br><br>The other part of this feature is meant to help agencies build
          groupings of their services, known as packages. Packages bundle several different types of
          services together to make it easier for clients to pay for several services at once at a specified
          rate.

        <h4>CREATING A PERSONA:</h4>
        <h6>When developing the first few features for Agency Hub, the product team at Cloud Campaign was under a time
          crunch and went straight to the design phase. That led to many iterations of the design, and once the beta
          release product was launched, the first task was to create a detailed persona.<br><br>The main persona we
          decided would use Agency Hub would be an Administrator for an account at a social media agency. Our persona
          was female, 35-40 years old, managing a team of 5 with 25-45 clients.

        </div>
        <br>
        <h6>Some of the biggest parts to stand out from the persona included: <br>
          <ul>
            <li>They want all of their information in one place</li>
            <li>The cost of using multiple tools is expensive<ul>
                <li><mark class="mark">"We pay for so many tools but only use 10% of each”</mark></li>
              </ul>
            <li>Their customer’s ideas and thoughts are always changing, and it's hard to keep up with</li>

      <div class="col-md">
        <h6>2. &nbsp <mark class="mark">Allow the design to be scalable.</mark> Agency Hub can be used for agencies with
          5 clients to agencies with 50 clients as well as 5 services to 50 services, and the pages should give the same
          experience regardless.

        <h4>DEVELOPING PRODUCT OUTLINE USING PRD:</h4>
        <h6>Using the Product Requirements Document(PRD) written by the Product Manager, I
          worked with 2 other UI UX
          designers to design an outline of what the Service Management feature would look like.</h6>
        <br>
        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="./photos/cloudcampaign1/brainstorming/Page1.png" class="screenshots">
        </div>
        <br>
        <h6>We used Figma Jam to create these outlines. The design was based on the existing layout of the beta launch
          Agency Hub product, with a menu bar on the right side. Service Management was added as a tab that could be
          clicked into. At the top of the page, there are two tabs, one for services and one for packages.<br><br>We
          kept the page flow fairly simple. The Services page had two different pages, one to create a
          service and one to see all current services an agency offers. There would be pop ups to assign a client to or
          delete a client from specific services, as well as a way to edit each service and their respective tiers.
          There was also a space for functionality to delete a service completely from an agency's offerings.<br><br>We
          duplicated this flow for the Packages page, keeping one to create packages and one to see all current
          packages, as well as pop ups to add, edit, or delete packages. <br><br>Once the outline included everything
          from the PRD and every functionality we wanted to add, we sent the file to the Product Manager and CEO for
          review and feedback.

        <h4>INTIAL DESIGN:</h4>

          going to fit all of the information in without overwhelming the users.</h6>

        <br>
        <h6>We built the navigation to the Service Management feature off of the previous Agency Hub designs, with a
          link through the side menu.<br><br>Both the services and packages pages were formatted in a similar table to
          ensure consistency. The tables were also constructed with an emphasis on scalability, so that companies could
          still navigate the page easily regardless of the number of services or packages they created. We included
          an easy menu to switch back and forth between each feature at the top of the page.

        <h6>For several of the mock-ups pages, we didn’t go into full depth with the pop-up screens, and instead added
          them to the side of the lo-fi design with comments so the Product Manager and CEO could understand our thought
          process.<br><br>Out of the pop-ups, the one we thought the most about was for deleting services. Often this
          button can be
          pressed accidentally, so we created an extra step for confirming deletion due to the large action that will
          occur if a service is deleted.<br><br><i>Second Iteration:</i><br><br>

          The users completed the tasks easily and with little thought. They were able to find out where certain
          functionality was stored within the page and understand how to use it very quickly. When asked how
          easy or difficult the page was to navigate, one of the testers stated “it was so easy a caveman could do it”.
          This was exactly what we wanted to hear! <br><br>The feedback that we got regarding changes was mainly due to
          confidentiality and management reasons. The users preferred that the ability to see the price of each service
          tier as well as the ability to delete a service or package should only be available to admin. In addition,
          they wanted a place to leave notes if they had any customizations. They had several small comments on the
          layout of some of multi-select, which we quickly mocked up, as seen in the designs below.<br><br><i>Changes
            Made:</i>

        <h6>When adding a client to a new service, we got feedback that having two places where you could select the
          clients and locations that you wanted to add to a service in the same pop-up was redundant. We took that and
          changed the upper part of the pop-up to a summary of the current clients on that service. Clients can still
          scroll down the list of clients below to see these clients and locations, but now they are only in one place.
        </h6>

          <img src="./photos/cloudcampaign1/afterusertest/CreatePackage.png" class="screenshots2">
        </div>
        <h6>We also got feedback on the amount of words on this page. When thinking of larger agencies with more clients
          and services, having the title of the service along with the tier of service was too much writing on one page.
          In addition, if an agency decided to have two tiers or four tiers for their services, the layout of the check
          boxes would be off. So we implemented an expandable table instead that still allowed for the select all
          locations capability.</h6>

        <h4>REFLECTION:</h4>
        <h6>This project taught me the most about user experience this summer. I got to experience the UX process from
          the very beginning of developing a persona to the very end of communicating the designs to engineers for
          development and launch. <br><br>Previous to this internship, I hadn’t gotten an opportunity to run through the
          UX process in full, and this real-world experience taught me a lot about being consistent, detail oriented,
          and collaborative. I had the best conversations with my fellow designers discussing the small details here and
          there on this feature that came together to make it as good as it could be for our users. I also got to
          understand the user’s wants and needs through several user interviews and user testing meetings throughout the
          summer.<br><br>A large part of user feedback went to praising the service they received with all employees
          from CC. My experience at Cloud Campaign taught me about <mark class="mark">teamwork</mark> and <mark
            class="mark">user centric design</mark>. I hope to take this experience and apply it in my future
          internships and career moving forward!
