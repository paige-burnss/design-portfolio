        <h6>
          <br>During Summer 2022, I was a Product Design Intern at <a href="https://www.cloudcampaign.com"
            class="linked">Cloud Campaign</a> (CC), a white-label, scalable social media management and marketing
          software company. As an intern, I worked on both their Social Suite product and Agency Hub beta-release
          product. <br><br> The other CC interns and I were also tasked with our own project to complete, focusing on
          the Admin
          Dashboard. The Admin Dashboard was used primarily by the sales team at CC to understand how well customers are
          using the platform, as well as what they could improve upon. Our project was to <mark class="mark">redesign the dashboard </mark>.

        <h4>PRODUCT AUDIT:</h4>
        <h6><i>What is the Admin Dashboard?</i> <br><br> The Admin Dashboard was built for <mark class="mark">internal
            use only.</mark> The Sales
          and Customer Support (CS) teams at CC needed a way to see details on an agency’s specific client accounts.
          This
          way, when they were working with these agencies, they could give strategies for using the current products the
          agencies were paying for. In addition, they could recommend other CC products that could allow the agency’s
          client to be more successful and intentional with their social media. <br><br> <i>The Previous Admin
            Dashboard:</i>
        </h6>
        <br>
        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="./photos/cloudcampaign/overviewofprevious/CCADMainPage.png" class="screenshots shadow" alt="image">
        </div>
        <br>
        <h6>The main page had repetitive statistics shown, such as the two places that reported the number of
          workspaces. In addition, some of the general statistics shown were not numbers that gave any indication on the
          success of CC clients.
        </h6>
        <br>
          <div class="image-stack">
            <div class="image-stack__item image-stack__item--top">

            </div>
          </div>
        <br>
        <h6>The rest of the main page was occupied by a long list of clients of CC. Each account had a tag identifying
          the plan that each client was paying for with CC, however several of those tags were not plans that CC
          offered.<br><br> By opening a drop down menu, you could see the accounts associated with each client. However,
          to
          see the details for a client's specific account, a login was required.<br><br>The list of clients was
          extremely
          long, as can be seen by the small scroll bar, and could only be filtered by
          a search bar at the top of the list.

        <br>
        <h6>There was a second page that could be accessed through a dropdown by the username in the top right corner.
          This page also held general statistics about all clients and their accounts. <br> <br> As for the specific
          workspace
          details, my team and I were unable to login to any of the workspaces on this admin dashboard, so we decided to
          design that functionality from scratch.

        <h4>USER RESEARCH - UNDERSTANDING THE NEEDS OF THE SALES TEAM:</h4>
        <h6>To understand what stats would be most useful for the CS team, we first comprised a list of questions to get

        <br>
        <h6> <i>Questions for the Sales Team:</i><br>
          <ul>
            <li>What data is currently used to seek and sell opportunities to potential clients currently?</li>
            <li>What date ranges would be useful for making these recommendations as well as beneficial for report
              compilation (i.e. month to month, quarterly, annually)?</li>
            <li>What format is most desirable for data representation?</li>
          </ul>
        </h6>
        <br>
        <h6>Our first obstacle was that we didn’t get a concrete answer to our main questions. CS
          representatives
          didn’t have exact data that they used every single time they spoke with customers. That meant that it was up
          to us to understand and prioritize certain data points over others in our designs. <br><br> In terms of date
          ranges, we got an overall consensus that any type of comparison over time was beneficial. For data
          representation, they wanted something “simple and easy” to understand. In addition, the CS team
          informed
          us that comparing a specific client to an average of our other users could be a helpful metric.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md">
        <h4>INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS AND INITIAL DESIGN:</h4>
        <h6>We then had to define what data was available for use on the Admin Dashboard. After consulting with both the
          engineering team and the customer support team, we learned that the main data that is tracked by CC can be
          seen in the Analytics tab in the Social Suite Product. <br><br> We created a <mark class="mark">user
            flow</mark> to understand how users
          would navigate from one section of information to the next, and used the following diagram to design the first
          iteration.<br>

            <img src="./photos/cloudcampaign/CCADUserFlows.png" class="screenshots1" alt="image">
          </div>
          While deciding on the most valuable data that
          could be taken from the current tracked data, we decided to make a <mark class="mark">low fidelity
            design</mark> in Whimsical of the layout we were thinking
          of.

          </a>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h6>For the pages that included data visualizations, we left them mostly blank because we didn’t know which data
          points we were featuring yet. With the low fidelity designs, we spent the most time conceptualizing the Client
          Page, making it easier to scroll through with a table format, and keeping it consistent with other CC products
          such as the <a href="./cloudcampaignSM.html" class="linked"> Service Management in Agency Hub</a>, which I
          also helped create. <br><br>We also designed a report
          builder that would allow the sales team to compose a custom pdf with certain data points for a client.
          However, that feature was more of a <mark class="mark">“nice-to-have”</mark>, and wasn’t a priority feature to
          be included in the final product.
          <br><br>Once the low fidelity design was complete with all the pages we knew we wanted to include, we ran the
          design
          by the engineers to see if the overall concept was feasible for them to complete in the timeline we were
          given.<br><br>We got approval from the engineers and pushed forward with starting the high fidelity designs.

        <h4>USER TESTING:</h4>
        <h6>Due to the short timeframe of our project, we got feedback from users and engineers while we were building
          the second iteration. We did not do formal user testing for this feature, rather small user testing with
          employees around the office for feedback.<br><br> Here are several of the changed we made throughout the

          We made all of the statistics and data move visual, so that the Sales team could understand and use this

          Social Suite, and the packages that clients have bought when they are using Social Suite for their
          businesses.<br><br>The main focus is CC’s overall post success rate. CC has a goal
          to have all post success
          rates above 90%, so once that entire table is green, they’ll be able to tell with this dashboard.

          homepage, but the charts are able to be filtered to a certain time period by using the “Start Date” and “End

          Through this page, users can see all the failed and successful posts of their workspace, and the number of
          followers over all of the workspace’s accounts. They can also filter the posts shown in the table and expand
          each row to navigate directly to the failed post and understand the reason behind
          the failure.

          This feature allows the user to see the top performing clients, top platforms used, and top posts of all CC’s
          clients. It also allows users to add comments on the report, and download the report as a .pdf to their
          computer.

        <h4>POTENTIAL NEXT STEPS:</h4>
        <h6>Currently, the scorecard is only for data gathered on all of Cloud Campaign’s clients, and cannot be
          filtered down to one client or one client’s specific workspace. I believe the next steps for the project
          would be to include this functionality of switching between “All Client”, “One Client All Workspaces”, and
          “One Client One Workspace” to create a downloadable report. <br><br> In addition, I think that adding some
          comparative abilities to the Admin Dashboard would be beneficial to show clients how well they are doing
          compared to Cloud Campaigns “average” client.

        <h4>REFLECTION:</h4>
        <h6>This project was my opportunity to lead the designs of a feature from start to finish. My product manager
          was there to help, but I guided the project throughout my internship. I understand the value of low fidelity
          designs versus high fidelity designs, as well as the benefits to a well developed prototype. <br><br>In
          addition, I learned the importance of thinking from many perspectives (customer support needs, design wants,
          and software engineering abilities and obstacles). The software engineers building this dashboard had to build
          the dashboard in the existing environment instead of starting from scratch, making the coding process more
          difficult. I had to keep that in mind when creating the new designs and was mindful to manage the amount of
          detail on each page. <br><br>Overall, my time at Cloud Campaign helped me learn so much about what I want in a
          future job. I loved the <mark class="mark">fast paced environment</mark> I was thrown into. I was able to have
          a <mark class="mark">direct impact</mark> on the
          product, and some of my design changes were even implemented before my internship was over.
