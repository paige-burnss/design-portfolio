          <br>During Summer 2023, I was a Product Management Intern at <a href="https://www.publicissapient.com"
            class="linked">Publicis Sapient</a>, a consulting company that helps companies and public sector organizations 
            keep up with technological change by assisting with digitial business transformations of different 
            processes. As an intern, I was put in a group with 8 other interns and assigned to a mock client project
            within the retail industry. <br><br>
            
            The problem we were asked to solve was regarding ad placement in grocery stores. I am unable to reveal the actual client
            I worked for, so for this description, I will be calling them XYZ Grocery, The current process for ad management
            was inefficient, error prone, and outdated. We were tasked with create an <mark class="mark">internal tool for 
              ad managers</mark> to be able to schedule and place ads within certain grocery stores throughout 
              the country using AI generated location suggestions.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md">
        <h4>RESEARCH - UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS:</h4>
        <h6> After getting the client problem statement, the first thing I worked on was truly
          understanding the problem and the current solutions that are already in place so that 
          I could find opportunities within the market for the product my team was building. <br><br>
          
          The problem statement mainly addressed print ads, but Publicis Sapient is a company branded
          on the premise of digital business transformations. Therefore, I wanted to <mark class="mark">determine whether 
          it was useful to focus this product more on digital ads rather than print ads</mark>. After conducting
          research online as well as exploring several grocery stores in Boston, I came to the conclusion
          that many of XYZ Grocery's stores don't have a large capacity to display digital ads in store
          yet. With this in mind, I decided to build the product around the placement of print ads,
          with the ability to expand into digital ad placement once XYZ Grocery had more capacity to 
          display these ads. <br><br>
        </h6>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md">
        <h6> The difficulty with this project was that it was a mock project, so I wasn't actively consulting
          with any actual potential users of the product I was building. With this being an application
          intended for internal use, the research process was a bit harder than expected. When it came to 
          understanding their current ad management process, <mark class="mark">I had to make a lot of assumptions</mark> and 
          rely on information that was readily available to the public online. In terms of competitors for 
          the product, I found mainly 3rd party solution such as Indoor Media and IMP Grocery. The downside
          of these solutions is that they are unattached from XYZ Grocery, and there is little control that 
          XYZ Ad Managers have over the process. This is precisely why our product was so important. </h6>

        <h6>The last part of the prompt to dissect was which demographics were most useful in determining
          where to place an ad. This was especially relevant because we were tasked with creating an AI
          resource that could recommend which demographics would be most useful to target for specific ads,
          which would in turn make the location recommendations for the ad more accurate for the 
          desired audience. My team and I brainstormed a long list of potential demographics to use in the system:

        <h4>RESEARCH - USER RESEARCH:</h4>
        <h6>The next step in the research process was understanding who would be using our product. Again,
          since this was a mock project, we didn't have direct communication with the client or the 
          intended users of the internal product. In order to more deeply understand our user(s), I created
          a few personas.<br><br></h6>

        <h6>Billy Smith was our main user, and who the MVP was mainly designed for. Billy 
          is a Media Partnership Associate at XYZ Grocery headquarters. His job consists of learnin what 
          retailers want for ad placement and accomodating those requests. He needs efficiency and organization
          within his job, and <mark class="mark">struggles with customizing solutions for each customer and spending time
          doing tedious, busy work.</mark><br><br>
          Marta Jones is the second potential user for this product. Once we defined base features that 
          would satisfy Billy's base needs, we thought about extra features that could be added to make 
          this product more unqiue and useful. Marta is the manager of a specific XYZ Grocery store. She 
          receives the ads that Billy assigns to her store and must manage when to put up and take down 
          the print ads in her store. It isn't always to easiest to understand when to do so with very little 
          communications from headquarters with the current process and system they use. <mark class="mark">The features I 
          brainstormed to help Marta were not included in the final prototype because of the short 
          project timeline</mark>, however, I outlined a few of these features in the "Next Steps" of the project.
          <br><br>
          Our final potential persona wasn't developed, but in the future we also wanted to develop an interface 
          for the retailers who wanted their ads placed. In "Next Steps", I discuss the details surrounding
           this persona and their wants and needs in relation to the product.

          </div>
           <br><br>
           In order to define what features should be included in our MVP, V1, and V2 of our product, I 
           <mark class="mark">created a user journey for Billy of how he might use the product we developed in day to day life.</mark>
           The tasks outlined in yellow came together to form the Upload Ad process. The tasks outlined in green 
           made up the Store Playlist Directory features. And the tasks outlined in blue made up the Ad Directory 
           features.

        <h6>Without an industry standard for this type of product, <mark class="mark">I decided to take inspirations from 
          other apps that I use frequently to format the layout of this product</mark>. Specifically, when it 
          came to the playlist directory, I modeled the playlist view off of the desktop version of 
          Spotify. <br><br>
          In addition, the playlist directory needed a complex search and filter feature in order to make 
          the directory useful for users such as Billy Smith. I took insprition from my university's 
          "Study Abroad Program Search" and modeled the filters off of that screenshot in later designs.
          The view ad page also took some inspiration from the Jira Epics page for the timeline.
          <br><br>
          With so much information that we needed to include in this product, I wanted to find the best 
          way to display this mass of information in the cleanest and simplest way possible. Therefore,
          brainstorming and looking for inspiration of many different ways to display data was a large part
          of the design process.

        <h6>For the first iteration, <mark class="mark">I developed the design for the MVP features before asking for feedback.</mark> I took 
          the very basic mockups from brainstorming, and flushed out a more professional look. I developed
          a few ideas of design items that I knew I wanted to be included into the product so that the engineers 
          on my team could start developing the base look of the product without the full figma final iteration
          complete. I asked for feedback and conducted user testing on these designs because the majority 
          of the rest of the product would be designed similarly to these features. 
          <br><br> Also note that these screenshots are missing logos and store names due to the
           confidentiality of the mock client.

        <h4>USER TESTING:</h4>
        <h6>Due to the quick nature of the project, I only had time for one iteration before asking for 
          feedback and providing the final designs to the engineers. The user testing process was extremely
          informal because we didn't have access to the target audience we were building the product for. 
          <br><br>
          I reached out to a product design coach within Publicis Sapient for feedback, and we also conducted usability
          tests within our intern cohort. The feedback I got was <mark class="mark">mainly regarding small details related to the 
          accessibility aspects of the product</mark>. I changed things such as text color and button background color 
          to make sure the contrast was visible to those with visibility impairments. 
          <br><br>
          I also <mark class="mark">specifically 
          asked for feedback on the information visible on each screen</mark>, and how to reduce feelings of information
          overload. Based on the feedback, I made a few big changes to the Playlist Directory Page:
          <br><br>
          <i>Changes Made:</i>

          <div class="text-center">
            <img src="./photos/ps/testing/8.png" alt="testing changes 1" class="screenshots2">
          </div>
          <h6>Initially, I realized that <mark class="mark">having a long list of ad playlists was not useful at all for 
            Billy to scroll through</mark>. When we added a search bar to the initial iteration, I got feedback 
            that there were too many different things that could be searched for to find a playlist that 
            the search feature would be kind of confusing to learn. From there, I developed several ways
            to search through the list, including a "favorites" feature and a detailed search filter function.
          </h6>
          <div class="text-center">
            <img src="./photos/ps/testing/9.png" alt="testing changes 2" class="screenshots2">
          </div>
          <h6>After that, I got feedback on the layout of the search results, <mark class="mark">learning that it was too similar 
            to the favorites feature, and took up too much screenspace for it to be used</mark>. After hearing this, 
            I changed the layout to be more table-like, and this got positive responses and had more potential
            to actually be used to be more efficient.

        <h6>The playlist directory is the home page of the product. I made the default view with the favorite

          search and filter options are the ones that would make most sense for what someone like Billy 
          would use to search for a playlist. In addition, the search
          results are displayed in a table, and the view is also paginated to reduce the amount of information 
          on the page.

        <h4>POTENTIAL NEXT STEPS:</h4>
        <h6>In terms of the engineering tasks, scaling for a larger database for the product shouldn't 
          be a problem because of the technologies the engineers used. In terms of product design, I would 
          want to conduct user testing with the actual users of this product. That would mean getting access
          to the MPA's at XYZ Grocery. In addition, I would want to get real data from XYZ Groceyr. The 
          data we used was generated by AI due to the mock nature of the product, so by <mark class="mark">getting real data, 
          the ad playlist recommendations would be more accurate.</mark><br><br>
          In terms of next steps for features, <mark class="mark">I planned out the next 3 sprints as well as larger future 
          features to impliment.</mark> In Sprint 5, I would like to implement a feature called "I know where I 
          want to place my ads", which would be useful when someone has very specific locations they want 
          to place their ad instead of using the recommendations. In addition, I want to make the location 
          recommendation based off of item popularity and season of the year. These are both features my 
          team wanted to add after the initial brainstorming session. Sprint 6 and 7 are outlined in the 
          presentation above. <br><br>
          In the far future, the Retailer view should be implemented and this product should be aligned with 
          XYZ Grocery's media collective, which would allow for the use of real, and more accurate data. All 
          of these steps would <mark class="mark">help lead XYZ Grocery to a more full digital business transformation.</mark>

        <h4>REFLECTION:</h4>
        <h6>This project taught me the <mark class="mark">importance of always placing the customer first</mark>. As I was leading 
          my team, I imagined that our persona Billy was our 10th team member. Keeping Billy in mind at 
          all times was important, especially when making assumptions on which features would be most 
          useful  to him, and therefore deciding the priority of features to build.<br><br>
          My team didn’t have any designers on it, so while my official role was a Product Manager, 
          I also took on many of the UX Designer responsibilities so that I could ensure that our product 
          was intuitive and useful for the target user. This meant that I had to balance both roles’ 
          responsibilities in order to keep the project moving and finish the MVP by the 
          end of the project timeline. <br><br> Overall, I loved the fast paced environment that I was 
          placed in throughout this internship. I learned so much about many parts of creating a product, 
          consulting with clients, and incorporating acccessibility into my designs. I also built 
          leadership skills when guiding my team through this project, and learned a lot about 
          communication and collaboration, as well as when to direct and when to let my team members 
          make their own decisions based on their specific areas of knowledge. </h6>
