          <br> In Fall 2022, I took a class called CSCI 3002: Fundamentals in Human Computer Interaction in the
          <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/engineering/" class="linked">Engineering School at CU Boulder</a>.
          In this class I learned about the process of developing a new application using user centric design thinking.
          <br><br> In this class, I worked with another student to <mark class="mark">complete the full user experience research 
          process as well as start developing a low fidelity design of an application.</mark> My partner and I created the 
          application Sundaland, a site that provides a space for small businesses who sell sustainable 
          products and customers who are looking for sustainable product options to connect.

        <h4>RESEARCH - PROBLEM SPACE:</h4>
        <h6>
          Sundaland’s main mission is to provide another option for consumers which avoids encouraging 
          hyper consumerism and waste while promoting sustainability. Many large 
          corporations today, such as Amazon, run their business on the principle of quantity over 
          quality. While this business model appeals to many people due to its convenience and 
          profitability, it is highly unethical. As many people start to favor online shopping over brick and mortar shops, 
          the influence of these major corporations are taking a toll on small businesses.<br><br>
          I found that there was a lack of ethical alternatives for websites like Amazon, and wanted to 
          fill that void with a business that is just as convenient for consumers. Sundaland’s goal is 
          to reduce today’s society’s reliance on huge corporations by <mark class="mark">providing a space for smaller 
          businesses to unite and reach more consumers, while also delivering higher quality products, 
          all in a sustainable way.</mark></h6><br>
        <h6><i>Key Stakeholders:</i><br><br></h6>
        <h6>1. &nbsp <mark class="mark">Environmentally Conscious Consumers:</mark> They are 
            motivated to reduce their carbon footprint, and have already implemented new habits 
            or are willing to learn. They also most likely have a higher income, due to the fact that 
            sustainable products are usually more expensive than other products.</h6><br>
        <h6>2. &nbsp <mark class="mark">Sustainable Small Businesses</mark> Sundaland’s 
            business model would also appeal to small businesses who struggle with losing their 
            clients to larger companies. Sundaland prioritizes getting small, local businesses 
            the exposure they need to reach their full potential.

          <h6>When making personas for this project, I decided to focus first on the customers 
            stakeholder as this would be easier to be put through user testing due to a larger 
            applicable target market to test.
            <br><br>
            The first character attribute I decided to focus on with the personas was how sustainably focused they are. 
            I took into account how aware they are of sustainable products, as well as if they 
            currently buy sustainable products or are interested in buying sustainable products. 
            The second character attribute I decided on was to measure how tech savvy they are. 
            This is to measure if they would be familiar with online marketplaces and would be able 
            to use Sundaland easily and efficiently. I was also looking to see if the personas would 
            be willing to learn certain behaviors that would allow them to use the platform. Lastly, 
            the third attribute I decided to use was the amount of budget allocated for online shopping. 
            I wanted to measure how much money the personas had to spend on online marketplaces. If they
            have a larger budget they would be more likely to spend more money for sustainable products as
             well.<br><br>
             <mark class="mark">A limitation of Mackenzie is that she might be hard to attract when Sundaland 
             first launches because of the increased price point.</mark> She is set in her routine because
            she has no time to try something new, but this could be an opportunity for Sundaland to 
            add in some sort of feature that creates an easy transition from other marketplaces. 
            <br><br>
            A large strength of Miranda is that she is 
            part of Sundaland's main target market. <mark class="mark">When creating the product, I first wanted to make sure 
            that the product was friendly to her, before focusing on accomodating other personas like Mackenzie.</mark>

          In order to gain a better understanding of my target market and their needs, I asked 
          questions mainly about Amazon and other major ecommerce websites, focusing on what 
          they liked or disliked, what items were purchased most frequently, and their opinion 
          on sustainability. I first asked questions about participants' shopping habits, and 
          then transitioned to questions more focused on sustainability, as to not lead the 
          participant’s answers to be biased due to the priming effect.<br><br><mark class="mark">My main goal was to collect data that would allow me to see competitor’s weaknesses 
            and strengths to strategically construct the business model to fill those gaps</mark>, while 
            also maintaining and improving upon the elements that participants liked. I also 
            collected data concerning participant demographics, including age, gender, and 
            occupation. This would give insight into who my customer base is and isn’t, which 
            will be crucial in the development of the business model. While most of the responses 
            were from college age students, I was able to generate responses from older demographics 
            as well. The survey generated 45 responses in total.

        <h6>Going by order of questions in the survey, the first thing I looked at was the 
          different most common online stores people use. <mark class="mark">All 45 participants shop on the Amazon 
          marketplace.</mark> Target and Walmart online marketplaces were also fairly popular, so I decided 
          to complete an analysis of their similar and different features to define the ones that would 
          work best for Sunderland's online marketplace.  </h6><br><br>
          <div class="text-center">
            <img src="./photos/csci3002/research/graph1.png" class="screenshots shadow" alt="image">
          </div>
          <br><br>
          <h6>I also found that out of all the categories that were surveyed, 
            technology is the most bought category on Amazon marketplace, followed by entertainment, 
            as seen above. However, the majority of the most recent Amazon purchases were kitchen 
            and bathroom items such as a cutting board, snacks, and espresso glasses. This could show 
            that the phrasing of the questions was potentially misleading. This was also a multiple 
            select question, so while technology was the most selected, all participants selected more 
            than one category. <mark class="mark">I decided to not take these answers into account due to the misleading 
            phrasing and resulting information.</mark> <br><br>
            Due to the fact that Amazon is most similar to what Sundaland will be based off of, 
            I decided to ask participants some of their favorite and least favorite features on the 
            Amazon marketplace.<br><br>Some of their favorite features included:
            <ul>
              <li>Easy to view the prices for each product on the marketplace</li>
              <li>Fast shipping after ordering</li>
              <li>Recommended tab using past purchases to show other products of interest</li>
              <li>Wish list or “save for later” tab</li>
              <li>Plenty of options for different products</li>
            </ul>
            Some of their least favorite features included:
            <ul>
              <li>Ugly website interface, overcrowded and not great color usage, and generally looks kinda tacky</li>
              <li>Returns and address changing pages are not user friendly (is this on purpose?)</li>
              <li>Too many repeats of items</li>
              <li>The recommendations are not actually anything of interest to a user</li>
              <li>Limited filter options</li>
            </ul></h6><br>
            <div class="text-center">

            </div>
            <br><br>
            <h6>
            When transitioning to seeing if people would be interested in more sustainable options, I got
             a positive response for who would be interested in buying more sustainable products. <mark class="mark">All of 
             the participants scored a 3 or higher on the scale of 1-5 in buying sustainable products.</mark> In 
             addition, 69% of participants scored themselves a 4 or higher. This means that there is a lot 
             of interest in the products that Sundaland would offer. However, when asked if one would be 
             willing to pay more for sustainable products, only about 50% of participants scored 
             themselves a 4 or higher, with several people also scoring a 2 out of 5 for interest. Even 
             still, there is decent interest in sustainable products and the price that comes with buying 
             them. <br><br>When surveying participants, I tried to get a broad spectrum of responses to the survey. 
             There was a pretty even split of genders, with 53.3% of participants being female and 46.7% of 
             participants being male. There was also a participant age range of 16-56 (the majority were still 
             between 18-22 but there were several responses that represented different age groups perspectives). 
             The sampling process was mainly convenience sampling, which made it hard to get a fully representative 
             sample, but it gave me some valuable insight that I planned to do when developing Sundaland.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md">
        <h6><br><i>Takeaways:</i><br><br>I felt that Sundaland filled a gap in the ecommerce market. 
          After analyzing the common online marketplaces, I found that there weren’t many options that 
          focused on accessibility, while also maintaining sustainability. Amazon, which would be Sundaland's
          main competitor, lacks environmental standards and also usability functions as a result of 
          their business model: quantity over quality. <mark class="mark">The biggest goal at Sundaland is maintaining 
          high standards of ethical procedure in all aspects paired with a higher quality user experience.</mark><br><br>
          
          Amazon has some aspects of the web design that are not as user friendly as they could be. 
          One issue that comes with having such a vast variety of products is the task of efficiently 
          sorting and prioritizing them. Many of the participants complained that there were too many 
          products offered on the site and it made it overwhelming to browse without searching for a 
          specific product. I wanted to aim to avoid this strictly functional approach by <mark class="mark">giving Sundaland's 
          customers better filter and sorting options.</mark> Additionally, simply carrying less items would 
          greatly reduce this issue. Another aspect of Amazon that many users dislike is the overall 
          user interface of the website. The participants found the website to be “tacky” and “ugly”. 
          Incorporating more character and stylistic designs into Sundaland’s web interface would not 
          only improve the user’s experience, but could potentially attract a wider variety of 
          demographics who value the website aesthetics.<br><br>
          The biggest challenge was going to be <mark class="mark">convincing customers to stray from their trusted 
          ecommerce sources.</mark> Many people are already very comfortable and familiar with Amazon and 
          other large corporations, making it difficult to present a compelling alternative. Regardless,
          my team and I were ready to try to develop an idea that would be competitive.

          on the home page, such as recent orders, recommendations for other products, and a 
          search bar. There would be a way to navigate to a user’s profile (either to login or view

          right corner of the page. 
          <br><br>Each local sustainable company will have a “company page”, where 
          users can learn about each company, their missions, sustainable processes, and their 
          top selling products. Each product will also have its own page where users can see 
          specific details about the creation of the product, the materials included, the price, 
          and different customizations of the products. Lastly, the 
          shopping cart will have a quick and easy purchase flow for users to understand.

        <h6>With the first iteration, I shifted focus to the second priority, engaging experience. 
          A few of the survey responses stated 
          that the Amazon interface looked tacky and wasn’t organized. <mark class="mark">I wanted to make Sundaland’s 
          interface easy on the eyes and easy to understand.</mark> I did that by only displaying 
          the most necessary information possible on each page, with additional information behind 
          drop down menus and screen pop-ups. I also planned to use colors that were easy on the eyes, 
          such as blue and green.
          <br><br>
          I included education into this product because
           not everyone knows about or understands sustainable products and their importance.
            By creating individual company pages, I allowed a new way to engage users more and 
            make them care more about and be more conscious of the products they are using. <br><br>

            The third priority is offering sustainable services.  The entire basis of Sundaland is providing more sustainable product choices to 
            customers. <mark class="mark">I wanted to only let local, zero-waste or carbon-net-neutral companies sell their 
            products on the website.</mark> In addition, I planned on <mark class="mark">having different options for shipping</mark>, 
            such as carbon negative and carbon neutral.</h6>

        <h4>USER TESTING:</h4>
        <h6>When going into the user testing, I brainstormed 7 tasks for the participant to complete in 
          order to see if all interactions in my designs were easy to understand and complete. These tasks 
          included:<br><br>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a new account and then login</li>
          <li>From the home page, filter out the products being shown to only show the category of bathroom products</li>
          <li>From the search results page, view more details about a specific product, and then find more information about the company that makes that product</li>
          <li> Add the specific product you were viewing to your cart</li>
          <li>View the contents of your cart and remove the last product in your cart</li>
          <li>Place an order with the items in your cart</li>
          <li>View your account profile and sign out</li>
        </ol><bR>
        After the user finished the list of tasks, I asked them the following questions for more feedback:
        <br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Were there any tasks that were unclear on how to complete?</li>
          <li>What is one feature you would like to be added to in order to make it more useful for your needs?</li>
          <li>Is this a platform that you would use as opposed to a platform like Amazon?</li>
        </ul><br>
        During user testing, I received mostly positive feedback with a few tweaks to make to the
        design. To start with the positives, logging in and adding to the cart went well. The white background 
        and pops of bright green were also found to be cohesive and stood out for each user, which led to 
        little difficulty navigating the pages. 
        <br><br>
        However, <mark class="mark">one of the features that was confusing to users was the filtering.</mark> 
         In our user testing, the participants were confused by the 
        filtering buttons, as there are “categories”, “shop by”, and “other filters” options right next 
        to each other. They had a hard time understanding the differences between the options, and it 
        took a few tries to complete the task. <br><br>
        <i>Changes Made:</i><br><br>
        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="./photos/csci3002/usertesting/ut1.png" class="screenshots" alt="image">
        </div><br>
        I decided to look at other online marketplaces and saw that they usually combined all their 
        filters under one drop down or side menu, then had several sub categories to further expand 
        within the filters. <mark class="mark">I chose which filters were most important and reorganized
         the filters under new group names.</mark> Lastly, I moved the drop down to a different 
         location on the screen to be more intuitive.<br><br>
         <div class="text-center">
          <img src="./photos/csci3002/usertesting/ut2.png" class="screenshots" alt="image">
        </div><br>
        Users also wanted to see the small business side of Sundaland, so I decided to make that interface
        for the second iteration. In order to do this, <mark class="mark">I changed the sign up page to have a distinction
        for the user of whether they were a buyer or a seller.</mark> This would be attached
        to their login so that they would be brought to the appropriate interface and functionality when logging in.

        <h6>In this design, I kept the 3 priorities defined above in mind. With this seller view, users can sign up to 
          sell their small business goods on Sundaland. They can view, edit, and manage their Company page and Product pages,
          which are seen by the buyers. They can also upload new products to their account, and mark other products as sold out.
          They are able to see stats about their profits and revenues, as well as manage who has access to their company account.

        <h4>NEXT STEPS:</h4>
        <h6>I conducted another round of user testing for the Seller side of Sundaland. This process was
          very similar to the first round of testing. I got more feedback on the buyer side of the 
          application as well as new feedback on the seller side of the application.<br><br>
          For the buyer side, I got feedback that the ‘add to cart’ function was kind of confusing 
          because there was no confirmation that anything got added to the cart, so I want to add a 
          pop-up confirming the item was added to the cart, as well as a counter by the cart icon 
          showing how many items are in the cart at any given time. <br><br>
          For the seller's side, I got feedback that the ‘edit’ function was a little unclear, so I want to
          change the display of the edit layout so that it is more clear what users can do by pressing that 
          button. I also want also want to further develop the ‘company stats’ capability so 
          that I can further understand what a user might want to see out of these statistics and 
          how they would want them to be displayed. <br><br>
          After adding these changes to the current designs, <mark class="mark">I would want to develop these designs into a
          high fidelity prototype for more user testing</mark>, continueing to move towards being able to pass 
          the designs off to developers to build.

        <h4>REFLECTIONS:</h4>
        <h6>This project allowed me to explore two of my passion areas: sustainability and user 
          experience design. I got a lot of exposure to UX research and understood how to find out 
          information about my users, competitors, and how to define the direction a product goes in. 
          <br><br>
          I also learned the importance of low fidelity designs. Previously, I had only completed user 
          testing on final, hi-fi prototypes in which everything was added to the designed screens. 
          However, <mark class="mark">this showed the importance of testing throughout the design process.</mark> The processes 
          in my lo-fi designs were intuitive enough for participants to navigate and provide feedback 
          with little guidance. I was able to get valuable feedback before moving forward and adding 
          details to my design. <br><br>
          Overall, this class proved useful in giving me more exposure to the beginning of the UX process 
          by forcing me to go deep into each research step before even moving to the designs. Often I 
          find myself skipping to designs because I really enjoy making them. But, without the research 
          I do previous to making designs, the designs I create may or may not be useful. <mark class="mark">This taught
           me to catch myself before jumping ahead in a process, because by skipping steps in the 
           beginning, I could add a lot more work and iterations for myself in the future.</mark> When working 
           for a real company, this insight is extremely important on time sensitive projects.<br><br>
