          <br><br>During Summer 2022, I was a User Experience Design Intern at <a href="https://www.cloudcampaign.com"
            class="linked">Cloud Campaign</a> (CC), a white-label, scalable social media management and marketing
          software company. As an intern, I worked on both their Social Suite product and Agency Hub beta-release
          product. <br><br> The other CC interns and I were also tasked with our own project to complete, focusing on
          the Admin
          Dashboard. The Admin Dashboard was used primarily by the sales team at CC to understand how well customers are
          using the platform, as well as what they could improve upon. Our project was to redesign the dashboard to be
          <mark class="ccmark">easy to navigate as well as restructure the information being displayed</mark> on the dashboard.

        <h4>FROM THE BEGINNING:</h4>
        <h6><i>What is the Admin Dashboard?</i> <br><br> The Admin Dashboard was built for internal use only. The Sales
          and Customer Support (CS) teams at CC needed a way to see details on an agency’s specific client accounts.
          This
          way, when they were working with these agencies, they could give strategies for using the current products the
          agencies were paying for. In addition, they could recommend other CC products that could allow the agency’s
          client to be more successful and intentional with their social media. <br><br> <i>The Previous Admin
            Dashboard</i>

          <img src="./photos/cloudcampaign/overviewofprevious/CCADMainPage.png" class="screenshots" alt="image">
        </div>
        <br>
        <h6>The main page had repetitive statistics shown, such as the two places that reported the number of
          workspaces. In addition, some of the general statistics shown were not numbers that gave any indication on the
          success of CC clients.
        </h6>
        <br>
        <div class="text-center">

        </div>
        <br>
        <h6>The rest of the main page was occupied by a long list of clients of CC. Each account had a tag identifying
          the plan that each client was paying for with CC, however several of those tags were not plans that CC
          offered.<br><br> By opening a drop down menu, you could see the accounts associated with each client. However,
          to
          see the details for a client's specific account, a login was required.<br><br>The list of clients was
          extremely
          long, as can be seen by the small scroll bar, and could only be filtered by
          a search bar at the top of the list.

        <br>
        <h6>There was a second page that could be accessed through a dropdown by the username in the top right corner.
          This page also held general statistics about all clients and their accounts. <br> <br> As for the specific
          workspace
          details, my team and I were unable to login to any of the workspaces on this admin dashboard, so we decided to
          design that functionality from scratch.

        <h6>1. &nbsp Determine the most useful statistics on the client use of the CC platform to display. Understand

        <h4>DEFINING THE NEEDS OF THE SALES TEAM:</h4>
        <h6>To understand what stats would be most useful for the CS team, we first comprised a list of questions to get
          to know the desired functionality and use of the Admin Dashboard.</h6>
          <br>
        <h6> <i>Questions for the Sales Team:</i><br>
          <ul>
            <li>What data is currently used to seek and sell opportunities to potential clients currently?</li>
            <li>What date ranges would be useful for making these recommendations as well as beneficial for report
              compilation (i.e. month to month, quarterly, annually)?</li>
            <li>What format is most desirable for data representation?</li>
          </ul>
        </h6>
        <br>
        <h6>Our first obstacle was that we didn’t get a concrete answer to our main questions. CS
          representatives
          didn’t have exact data that they used every single time they spoke with customers. That meant that it was up
          to us to understand and prioritize certain data points over others in our designs. <br><br> In terms of date
          ranges, we got an overall consensus that any type of comparison over time was beneficial. For data
          representation, they wanted something “simple and easy” to understand. In addition, the CS team
          informed
          us that comparing a specific client to an average of our other users could be a helpful metric.

    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md">
        <h4>DRIVING UX DECISIONS:</h4>
        <h6>We then had to define what data was available for use on the Admin Dashboard. After consulting with both the
          engineering team and the customer support team, we learned that the main data that is tracked by CC can be
          seen in the Analytics tab in the Social Suite Product.
