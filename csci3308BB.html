        <h6>
          <br> In Spring 2022, I took a class called CSCI 3308: Software Development Methods and Tools in the
          <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/engineering/" class="linked">Engineering School at CU Boulder</a>.
          In this class I learned front-end design and construction as well as
          back-end database design and construction, and full-stack integration. <br><br> As a part of this class, I was
          also put into a team with 4 other students to build an application from start to finish using the information
          we were learning in the class. My group decided to build Budget Buddy, an application that could help college
          students and young professionals <mark class="mark">budget their life and learn more about financial
            management</mark>.

        <h4>FROM THE BEGINNING</h4>
        <h6><i>Brainstorming Ideas:</i> <br><br> As a team, we decided to first split up and do some individual
          brainstorming for ideas of an application, then come together and share our ideas to narrow them down to our
          final choice. We had to keep our timeline in mind, as well as all of the project requirements given to us by
          the professor when creating these ideas. <br><br> Some of the requirements included:
          <ul>
            <li>Needs a login of some sort</li>
            <li>Stores and retrieves data from a database</li>
            <li>Calls an API</li>
          </ul>
          When we came together, we compiled a list of the following ideas:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>Volunteer Connector</li>
            <li>Habit Tracker</li>
            <li>Itinerary Maker for Road Trips</li>
            <li>Sustainability Tracker</li>
            <li>Budget Tracker</li>
            <li>Food Website that Provides Recipes</li>
            <li>Restaurant Suggester</li>
          </ul>
          When we all explained the details behind each idea, we ended up voting to develop the <mark
            class="mark">Budget Tracker</mark>.
        </h6>
        <br>
        <h6><i>Initial Application Description:</i> <br><br> Budget Buddy is aimed at helping college students and young
          professionals budget their life. This application will include several features, including a spending and
          income log, a savings predictor, and an educational element to teach the young audience about investing and
          other financial management tasks.<br><br>Users will be able to easily log every expense they have into the
          software. They will be able to categorize their expenses to see where they spend the bulk of their money and
          where they might need to budget. They will also be able to log their income in the app to be able to notice if
          they are <mark class="mark">living above their means</mark> (spending more than they make) or not. <br><br>There will be several visualization
          tools such as tables and graphs that will help users visualize their spending habits and detect patterns for
          where they could reduce their spending. Users will then be able to implement a budget goal within the
          application (ex. “I will spend $200 a month on groceries”) and track their expenses to stay below their set
          budget. Users will also be able to set budgets for different periods of time (i.e. per month, per year, per
          semester, for summer, etc.). <br><br>Connected with the budget feature, there will be a savings predictor feature that
          allows users to see the amount of savings they will have if they stay within their newly set budget. This way,
          if a user has a certain savings goal, they will be able to set the correct budget to meet that goal.
          <br><br> The last feature of the application will be an educational feature. This part will hold information
          on how
          users will be able to start using more financial management tools and <mark class="mark">invest/save their money</mark> for
          their futures. This will include information on starting a user’s 401k, Roth IRA, investing in stocks, etc.
          There will be information in the application as well as links to other sites, tutorials, classes, and
          companies that can help users begin their financial journey.
        </h6>
        <br>
        <h6><i>Initial Vision Statement:</i><br><br> For college students and young professionals who need a way to
          track their finances and budget themselves, the Budget Buddy is a financial software application that allows
          users to log their spending and income to <mark class="mark">create a sustainable budget</mark>. The
          application will also include an
          educational section where users can find information on how to start investing and managing their finances.
          Unlike Intuit Mint, our product is geared towards a younger audience who are looking to learn about finances
          in addition to budgeting themselves.

        <h4>DESIGN:</h4>
        <h6>I took the primary responsibility of designing the initial look of the application on Figma. I first made a
          logo for the application to include on each page.</h6>

        <h6>I tried to keep the design as simple as possible so that we could spend the bulk of our time working on the
          back-end components, but I also went for a <mark class="mark">clean and consistent</mark> look over the entire application.</h6>
